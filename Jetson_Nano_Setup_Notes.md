```

If this error appears  
```
WARNING: The directory '/home/$USERNAME/.cache/pip' or its parent directory is not owned or is not writable by the current user. The cache has been disabled. Check the permissions and owner of that directory. If executing pip with sudo, you may want sudo's -H flag.
```
try  

```
sudo chown -R $USERNAME /home/$USERNAME/.cache/pip
```

sudo chown -R todd /Users/todd/Library/Caches/pip  


Skip this  
Setup Virtual Env   

```
sudo pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper
```

Add virtualenvwrapper information to ~/.bash  

```
nano ~/.bashrc
```

add the following to the end of the document  

```
# virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
export PATH=/home/nvidia/cmake-3.13.0/bin/:$PATH
```

save and exit  

load the bash profile  

```
source ~/.bashrc
```

Create Virtual Environments  
Some Helpful Commands  

Create a Python virtual environment  
```
mkvirtualenv $ENVNAME -p python3
```

List virtual environments installed on your system  
```
lsvirtualenv
```

Remove a virtual environment  
```
rmvirtualenv $ENVNAME
```

Activate a Python virtual environment  
```
workon $ENVNAME
```

Exits the virtual environment taking you back to your system environment  
```
deactivate
```

Create an env  

```
mkvirtualenv py3cv4 -p python3
```

Install the Protobuf Compiler  

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkjung-avt/jetson_nano/master/install_protobuf-3.6.1.sh
sudo chmod +x install_protobuf-3.6.1.sh
./install_protobuf-3.6.1.sh
```

This may take a long time - get a coffee or tea  

install protobuf in your Virtual ENV  

```
workon py3cv4 # if you aren't inside the environment
cd ~
cp -r ~/src/protobuf-3.6.1/python/ .
cd python
python setup.py install --cpp_implementation
```

Install TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and SciPy  
If you aren't inside the environment  

```
workon py3cv4
```

Install NumPy and Cython  
(An error may appear here - refer to the source link for the solution)  

```
pip install numpy cython
```

Install SciPy  
This is done without pip due to combatibility issues between tensorflow 1.13.1 and SciPy 1.3.3  

```
wget https://github.com/scipy/scipy/releases/download/v1.3.3/scipy-1.3.3.tar.gz
tar -xzvf scipy-1.3.3.tar.gz scipy-1.3.3
cd scipy-1.3.3/
python3 setup.py install
```
This may take a long time - get a coffee or tea  


TensorFlow

https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/jp/

Install tensorflow

The install can be performed automatically, however, there are some inconsistancies between the NVIDIA docs and real life. ie. no TF packages for JP 4.5. This line of code throws an error:

```
sudo pip3 install --pre --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/jp/v45 tensorflow
```

THis line will/should work:

```
$ sudo pip3 install --pre --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/jp/v44 tensorflow
```

The above line should install the latest version of TF. 

We dont always want the latest version and require a specific one. So we resort to grabbing the packages according to what we need.  

This section can be confusing - to target the correct version, we need to know:  
TensorFlow Version  
NVIDIA TensorFlow Container  
JetPack Version  

This link will tell us what matches what  
https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/install-tf-jetson-platform-release-notes/tf-jetson-rel.html  

This link has all the available versions. Currently(21.01.26), there are no versions for JP 4.5  
https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/jp/  

from the above information a command can be made where:

$JP_VERSION = jetpack version. this is not necessarilly the version you are using, this is a folder where the TF is kept
$TF_VERSION = the TF version
$NV_VERSION = NVIDIA TensorFlow Container

```
sudo pip3 install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/jp/v$JP_VERSION tensorflow==$TF_VERSION+nv$NV_VERSION
```
  
  
  
This is being installed on Jetpack 4.5  

Install tensorflow 1.13.1  

```
pip install --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/jp/v42 tensorflow-gpu==1.13.1+nv19.3
```
OR  

install TF 1.15.4  

```
sudo -H pip3 install --pre --extra-index-url https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/jp/v44 tensorflow==1.15.4+nv20.12
```

Install Keras

```
pip3 install keras
```

Install the TensorFlow Object Detection API (TFOD API)  
https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/tf_trt_models  

If you aren't already inside the environment  

```
workon py3cv4
```

Clone the models repository from TF

```
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models
```
