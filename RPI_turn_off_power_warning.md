The RPI will often place a yellow lighening bolt in the upper right hand corner. 

This is a low power warning.  

Many times, it does not affect the performance.  

Turn off the low power warning  

open the config.txt. 
~~~
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
~~~

Add one of the 2 commands to the end of the document.  
~~~
# Disable under-voltage warning
avoid_warnings=1
~~~
or 

~~~
#allows turbo when low-voltage is present
avoid_warnings=2
~~~

Reboot the RPI  
~~~
sudo reboot
